## Overview

The Users Management Service is responsible for handling all user-related operations within our application, including user registration, authentication, profile management, and security features such as password reset and email verification.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Allows new users to register by providing essential details such as username, email, and password. The registration process also includes sending a verification email to confirm the user's email address.
- **Authentication**: Supports various authentication mechanisms, including token-based authentication, to ensure secure access to the application.
- **Profile Management**: Users can update their profiles and manage settings like email preferences and account details.
- **Password Management**: Includes features for password change and reset, enhancing the security and usability of the application.
- **Email Verification**: Ensures that the email provided by users during registration is valid and belongs to them.

## Technical Details

- **Framework**: Django 5.0
- **API**: Django REST Framework for creating RESTful services.
- **Database**: MySQL, connected via Djangoâ€™s ORM.
- **Authentication**: Token-based authentication using Django REST Framework's token system.
